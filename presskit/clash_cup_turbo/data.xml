	Clash Cup Turbo is a colorful 2-4 player local multiplayer sports game, focused on crazy fun competition with friends and family. Smack the puck into the opponent's goal in a variety of stylized levels filled with obstacles and traps.

	<history>
	Clash Cup Turbo was by classic local multiplayer games that were deep and satisfying, yet simple and accessible. Our art director Mike pitched the idea to the team, focusing on 4-player local multiplayer, accessible 1-button controls, and a unique art style, and we couldn't resist trying it out. We jammed on the game for about 10 days, just in time to show off a 1v1 version at VGU Con in DC, and it was a big hit. Ever since then, we've been expanding the game with more levels, special moves, modes, and constant playtesting to make the most satisfying, beautiful, and accessible game we can.
